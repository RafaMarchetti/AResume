# AResume
An eye-tracking research found out that recruiters spend only 6 seconds reviewing 
an individual resume (http://cdn.theladders.net/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf). 

AResume is an augmented reality app that makes the process of reading a resume fun and interactive. It does so by
including virtual buttons and media content. Users can tap on virtual buttons in the paper-resume and it would 
trigger designated actions in the app. Media content can include videos, portfolio material, 3D objects, 2D objects etc.

The app was made using Unity3D, Vuforia SDK, and Android Studio.

Have fun recruiters in reading my resume through this app!

Here are some screenshots of the app:
