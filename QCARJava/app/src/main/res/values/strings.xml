    <string name="about_text_sub">"An eye-tracking research found out that recruiters spend only 6 seconds reviewing an individual resume. \n\n<b>AR</b>esume is an augmented reality app that makes the process of reading a resume fun and interactive. \n\nIt does so by including virtual buttons and media content. Users can tap on virtual buttons in the paper-resume and it would trigger designated actions in the app. Media content can include videos, portfolio material, 3D objects, 2D objects etc.  \n\nThe app was made using Unity3D, Vuforia SDK, and Android Studio. It works best under natural lighting conditions. \n\nHave fun recruiters in reading my resume through this app! \n\n-Tousif"</string>
